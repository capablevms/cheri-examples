# This is designed to be run by .buildbot.sh, but can also be run manually too,
# as long as you have a suitable environment, and an execution platform set up
# and running so that the make-based run-* targets have something to connect to.
# Notable environment variables:
#
# - BUILDBOT_PLATFORM
#   - Used to find the example makefile. Set to something like "morello-purecap"
#     or "riscv64-purecap".
# - SSHPORT
# - SSHUSER (defaults to 'root')
# - SSHHOST (defaults to 'localhost')
#
# TODO: Extend this to cover interactive examples and other architectures.
# For now, we just test examples on `morello-hybrid`.
