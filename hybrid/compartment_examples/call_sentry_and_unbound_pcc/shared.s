    // alignment logic. In addition, the range [stack, stack+size) must be
    // exactly representable as capability bounds.
    //
    // This example bounds the PCC, but there is potentially other ways to leak
    // information. Particularly, when the compartment function call returns,
    // there is a small window where the PCC is unbound due to calling a
    // sentry.
    //
    // The new stack space must be wholly enclosed by the current DDC.
