/* In this example, we tighten security even further, building on previous
 * examples [1]. We store the DDC and the PCC of `switch_compartment`
 * consecutively within its own bounds. Then, we create a capability pointing
 * to the DDC, which is sealed such that it can only be used in an `lpb`-type
 * call, and provide local copies of this capability to each compartment. Thus,
 * compartments are allowed to call `switch_compartment` via `ldpblr`, without
 * access to either its PCC or DDC (by nature of capabilities).
 *
 * The local copies are stored in the heap space of each compartment (as we do
 * not implement memory management at this point, this has no bearing at
 * present, but most likely will in the future). This could essentially be
 * considered a separate region of memory. Further, when using the local
 * capabilities to call `switch_compartment` from a compartment, the
 * destination register *must* be `c29`.
 *
 * Note that in the current design, each compartment has a single function it
 * executes when it is called. Allowing multiple entry points can be modelled
 * by having more capabilities be saved, in addition to the compartment
 * switching one, in each compartment's heap. Alternatively, we could, within
 * the compartment switcher, determine in which compartment we need to switch
 * to call a given function, based on PCC bounds for each compartment.

 * Additionally, we also changed the expected memory layout in the
 * compartments. In the absence of a custom memory allocator, we note that the
 * heap is not used, except for manually storing the local capability copy as
 * detailed above. Current compartment memory layout:
 *
 *       -----------------  < DDC + total_comp_size
 *      |  switcher_call  |
 *      |                 |
 *      |       ^         |
 *      |      HEAP       |
 * sp > |-----------------| < DDC + comp_stack_size
 *      |     STACK       |
 *      |       v         |
 *       -----------------  < `DDC value`
